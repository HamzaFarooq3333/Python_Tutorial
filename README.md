Modules are part of code which we do not write but we can use them in out program
<br>
There are 2 types of modules
<br>
1-Built-in module
<br>
(They are already present in our code they do not need to be imported externally)
<br>
2-External module
<br>
(They are not present in our code they need to be imported externally written by someone else)
<br>
->Note:
<br>
1-Modules help us avoid writing the basic part of code for our project 
<br>
2-Modules help us to reuse the code
<br>
3-Module contain code that have less chance of error because they are tested by many people
<br>
