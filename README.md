Sets is a datatype that does not allow us to repeat a variable in it .It is an unordered collection of well define objects seperated by comma and enclosed in curly brackets
<br>
Sets are unchangeable.We cannot change them when they are once created
<br>
Items in sets occur in random order and thus cannot be accessed using indexing 
<br>
We use for loop for accessing the items in the set in a random order 
<br>
There many methods for set like:
<br>
1-Union (This method prints all the elements in the 2 sets by returning a new set)
<br>
2-Update (This method prints all the elements in the 2 set by adding the itemsn from one set into another existing set)
<br>
Other methods in code
