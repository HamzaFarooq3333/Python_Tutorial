Function is a several lines of code that we can define for a specific purpose
<br>
We can use that code many times without writing the same code we just call that function
<br>
It is very useful because if there is a mistake in the code we do not need to fix that mistake at every place we used that code
<br> 
We just need to fix the code in the function once.
<br>
It helps reuse the code without copy pasting it again and again when needed
<br>
Funtion are of 2 types
<br>
1. Built in function(Already present in python for use in code)
<br>
2. User defined function(We create our own function for use in code)
<br>
->We use pass in function it tells the compiler that we will define this function later so pass on this code after this function 
<br>
->We can use return in function to return a value from the function
<br>
<br>
There are 4 types of arguments that we can provide in a function 
<br>
1. Required arguments
<br>
(Incase we do not pass arguments with key-value syntax.It is important we pass the arguments in correct positional order and the number of arguments should match total number of arguments)
<br>
2. Keyword arguments
<br>
(We provide argument with key=value this way the interpreter recognizes the arguments by the parameters name and the order in which the argument is passed does not matter)
<br>
3. Default arguments
<br>
(We provide the function with a default value in this way the function assumes those default values if arguments are not given when function is called)
<br>
4. Variable length arguments
<br>
(Somtimes we need more arguments than those defined in the actual function.We can do it in 2 ways)
<br>
-->Arbitary Arguments
<br>
(We pass a * in the function with parameter name while defining it.The function accesses them and processes them in the form of a tuple)
<br>
-->Arbitary keyword arguments
<br>
(We pass a ** in the function with parameter name while defining it.The function accesses them and processes
them in the form of a dictionary)
