If-else conditions are used when we want to perform different actions for certain inputs
<br>
We have if ,else ,elif statments for this purpose
<br>
elif is used when we have more than 2 different outputs for the user input in our program 
<br>
If one of the statements is satisfied then the other statements after it are not checked 
<br>
We can use nested if ,else,elif statements in our program
<br>
->Note:-
<br>
1-Becareful when using nested if ,else ,elif statements because in pyhton you can get error on extra spaces
<br>
2-Extra spaces can cause your program to go into another if,else condition instead of the desired one.
