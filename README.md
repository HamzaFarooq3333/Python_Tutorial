Match case is a new addition in python 3.10 
<br>
Match cases are used instead of if-else statements when we want to give many different ouputs on different inputs
<br>
In c++ we have to write break statement after each case because the other case might also match in c++
<br>
But in python we don't need to write break statement after each case because python will automatically stop 
when a case is matched it does not match other statments
<br>
We can write multiple default cases by using if case else and elif cannot not be used in match cases
