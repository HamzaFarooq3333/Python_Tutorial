Conversion of one datatype into another is called typecasting 
<br>
If we add  string variables a=1,b=2 we will get 12 instead of 3
<br>
If we use tyecasting and convert it into integer then we will get 3.
<br>
Type casting is of 2 types
<br>
1-Explicit conversion
<br>
(The programmer himself wants to convert a datatype in to another one)
<br>
2- Implicit conversion
<br>
(The compiler itself converts a datatype into another one)
