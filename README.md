Loops are used when we want to repeat an action again and again
<br>
There are 2 types of loops for loop and while loop
<br>
We can also use nested while and for loop in python
<br>
Loops can iterate over a sequence of iterable objects in python like:list ,string ,etc
<br>
Indentation refers to adding the relevant number of tabs and spaces at the beginning of lines of code 
<br>
It indicate a block of code in Python
<br>
Range is a function used in loops which works as let i=3,n=6 range(start,stop,step)
<br>
We will get the output starting from i and end on n-1
<br>
Step tells us that how many further steps we have to go after each iteration .It is like i++ in c++
<br>
We tell that how much i will go further is step is 2 then i+=2 and so on like in c++
<br>
We use while loop with complex conditions
<br>
We can also use else statement with while loop.When the condition in while loop becomes false else statement becomes true
<br>
Do-While loop is present in other languages  but it is  not present in python
<br>
Do-While loop is like a while loop which is executed once  irrespective that the condition is true or false
