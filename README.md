Dictionaries are ordered collection of data items.They store multiple values in a single variable.Dictionary items are key values-pair they are seperated by comma and enclosed in curly brackets.
<br>
The values in a dictionary can be excessed using keys which hold the specific value.
<br>
The use is to create a mapping somewhat similar to  hashmaps that  are used in c++.
<br>
Methods used in dictionaries are follwoing:
<br>
1-Pop  (Removes the key value pair whose key value is inserted)
<br>

<br>
4-Keys (Returns a list of all keys)
<br>
5-Values (Returns a list of all values)
<br>
6-Items (Returns a list of all key value pairs)
<br>
7-Update (Updates the dictionary with the items from another dictionary or from an iterable of key-value)
<br>
8-Get (Returns the value for the given key if it exists in the dictionary)
<br>
9-Setdefault (Adds a key in the dictionary without a value paired to it )
<br>
10-Fromkeys (Returns a new dictionary with the specified keys and values.You will get a new dictionary having all the keys in the input dictionary having the same input value)
<br>
11-Get (Returns the value for the given key if it exists in the dictionary)
<br>
