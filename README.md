Strings are immuteable(cannot be changed) when you use function like upper you get a new string 
<br>
The existing string does not change but intead you get a new string from that string 
<br>
Anything in single or double quotes in python is a string it is like an array of characters
<br>
Multiplw lines in a string can be written using triple double or single quote
<br>
Indexing allows us to display a specific character from our string but we cannot get out of the index bound 
<br>
We can slice a string displaying a specific part of the string by using starting and ending index
<br>
We can use the len() function to get the length of the string
<br>

->Note:-
<br>
1-String slicing works as string[starting_index,ending_index]
<br>
2-If your index goes out of bound in index slicing it does not give  error it is different from indexing 
<br>
3-Begin should be smaller then end if you want to print something within range
<br>
4- Fruit[1:4] in this case the characters printed will start from 1 but will not include 4 in them.
