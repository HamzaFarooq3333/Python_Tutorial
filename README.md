Break  statements are used when we want to exit or exit the loop at a particular iteration and terminate the loop
<br>
Continue statement is used when we want to skip the code of body  loop for that particular iteration and then continue from the next 
<br>
We can implement a do-while loop using the break statement in our while loop
<br>
1-Break statement terminates  the complete loop
<br>
2-Continue statement skips the current iteration of the loop and continues with the next iteration.
