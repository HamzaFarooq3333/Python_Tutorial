List is a datatype which is used to store a lot of data about a particular entity in a single entity
<br>
List is an ordered collection of data items that stores multiple items in single variable.List is changeable meaning we can change it after creation 
<br>
A list can contain more than one type of datatypes 
<br>
We can access any item in list using index but it should be within the range of the total size of list 
<br>
We can search for an element in a list but the datatpe of the element should be the same as the datatype of that element present in the list
<br>
We can print elemets in a list using indexing like  in a string.
<br>
List comprehension is used for creating new lists from other iterateables like  lists,tuples,dictionaries,sets and even array and strings

-->Follwoing are the methods in a list 
<br>
1-Append  (This method puts an element at the end of the list )
<br>
2-Insert (This method inserts an element at a specified position in the list )
<br>
3-Remove (This method removes the first occurrence of the value in the list )
<br>
4-Extend (This method adds multiple elements or lists  to the end of the list )
<br>
5-Index (This method returns the index of the first occurrence of the value in the list )
<br>
6-Count (This method returns the number of occurrences of the value in the list )
<br>
7-Sort (This method sorts the list in ascending order )
<br>
8-Reverse (This method reverses the list )
<br>
9-Remove (This method removes the first occurrence of the value in the list )
<br>
10- Pop (This method removes the element at the specified position in the list )
<br>
11- Clear (This method removes all elements from the list )
<br>
<br>
-->Following are the methods in a list which are used for searching
<br>
1-Index (This method returns the index of the first occurrence of the value in the list )
<br>
2-Count (This method returns the number of occurrences of the value in the list )
<br>
<br>
-->Following are the methods in a list which are used for sorting
<br>
1-Sort (This method sorts the list in ascending order )
<br>
2-Reverse (This method reverses the list )
<br>
-->Note:-
<br>
1-List is a mutable data type
<br>
2-We can add 2 lists without changing the original list by using concatination like ( list1 + list2 )
<br>
3-Extend changes the original list
