Tuples are oredered collection of data items.They can store multiple items in a single variable.Tuples are seperated by comma and enclosed in round brackets.They are unchangeable meaning they cannot be changed after creation
<br>
When we use the methods of tuples we get a new tuple the original tuple does not change
<br>
Lists are changeable while tuple and strings are unchangeable 
<br>
If we want to change a tuple then we have to convert the tuple in a list then we make changes in the list and then again convert it into a tuple 
<br>
We can use all the methods in the list in tuples after firstly converting it into list and then back into tuple
<br>
We can use index method in tuple along with slicing.
